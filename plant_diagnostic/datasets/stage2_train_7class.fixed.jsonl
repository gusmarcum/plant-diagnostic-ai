Many leaves are uniformly wilted and curling downward, their surfaces dull and papery rather than glossy, and large sections have turned brick-red to brown with crisp edges, all indicating moisture stress rather than patchy disease. The discoloration is most intense on older foliage and is accompanied by shriveled runners and exposed, dry soil between plants, further supporting insufficient water supply. These symptoms point to prolonged shallow watering or missed rainfall that failed to replenish soil moisture in the 10–15 cm root zone. Immediately provide a deep irrigation of about 8 L (2 gal) per m², allowing water to infiltrate at least 15 cm (6 in) down, then repeat every 3–4 days until normal vigor returns. Spread a 2–3 cm (¾–1¼ in) layer of clean straw mulch under and between crowns to reduce evaporative loss and keep roots evenly moist. Where possible, switch to a drip line delivering roughly 2 L (½ gal) per plant during each scheduled watering to maintain consistent moisture without wetting foliage. Over the next 7 days, visually check midday leaf posture; leaves should regain firmness and lie flat rather than curling. Probe the soil with a finger or moisture meter to 10 cm depth; it should feel cool and damp, not powder-dry. Also watch for the emergence of new green leaflets replacing the reddened, brittle ones, confirming recovery."}]}

The foliage is markedly wilted and hanging limp over the pot rims, leaf surfaces appear dull and slightly puckered, several edges show pale yellow-brown desiccation, and the potting mix on top is light-colored and visibly crusted, all indicating acute water deficit. These clues point to insufficient moisture retention in the stacked containers, where direct sun and vertical drainage likely accelerate evaporation. Immediately soak each pot until water runs freely from the bottom holes, delivering about 1–1.5 L (roughly 4–6 cups) per 20 cm (8 in) pot, then maintain soil moisture by adding 2–3 cm (1 in) of straw or leaf mulch and watering to a 5 cm (2 in) depth every other morning. Shift the tower to receive only early-morning sun or provide a shade cloth from noon to 4 pm to cut leaf surface heat and reduce transpiration. Over the next week, check soil with a finger to the second knuckle (5 cm) twice daily and water whenever it feels dry; leaves should regain firmness within 24–48 h. Also watch for new upright leaf petioles emerging from the crown and a return of glossy green color as confirmation of recovery. Finally, inspect the mulch layer each morning to be sure it still covers the surface evenly and has not blown away, adding more if gaps wider than 3 cm (1 in) appear."}]}

Frost likely struck the open flower or very young fruit, damaging some cells while leaving others viable, so growth resumed irregularly when temperatures rose. Immediately protect remaining plants with a 25–30 g m⁻² floating row cover each evening when forecasts dip below 2 °C (35 °F), and lay 15 cm (6 in) of clean straw mulch between rows to trap ground heat; if a Frost warning is issued, run overhead irrigation delivering about 3 mm (⅛ in) water per hour from −1 °C until temperatures rise above 0 °C to buffer latent heat. Improve night-time airflow by trimming excess foliage touching the soil and ensure beds drain freely so cold air does not pool. Over the next 7 days, inspect every morning for newly blackened blossom centers, feel the youngest berries for hard, glassy spots that do not give under gentle thumb pressure, and read a min-max thermometer placed at canopy height to confirm lows stay above freezing; repeat the protective measures whenever lows approach 2 °C."}]}

These features point to balanced moisture and nutrient status, strong photosynthesis, and an absence of active fungal or insect pressure. Maintain this condition by irrigating at the base to a depth of 5–7 cm (2–3 in) every 2–3 days, letting the upper 2 cm of soil dry before the next watering; lay 2 cm (¾ in) of clean straw mulch around but not touching the crown to retain moisture and keep fruit clean; and prune excess runners so that 20 cm (8 in) of space remains between crowns for airflow. Provide 6–8 hours of morning sunlight and gently shake foliage after rain to disperse standing water and reduce disease risk. Over the next 7 days, verify that new leaves emerge bright green without speckling, soil remains moist but not waterlogged, and ripening berries stay firm without gray fuzz or soft spots. Also monitor that no more than 20 % of foliage turns bronze or brown; if that threshold is exceeded, reassess drainage and nutrient supply."}]}

Immediately reduce irrigation to just 250 ml every 3 days, applying water slowly until only a slight drip appears from the pot’s base, and allow the top 3–4 cm (1.5 in) of soil to dry before the next watering; raise the container on 2 cm (¾ in) spacers to increase airflow under the base and improve drainage; and remove all dead foliage with sanitized scissors to limit opportunistic rot organisms. Over the next week, feel the soil daily to 5 cm (2 in) depth—proceed with watering only if it is barely damp, observe whether new leaf petioles stand upright within 48–72 h, and watch for the soil surface turning a lighter brown rather than staying black and shiny. A musty or sour odor, further yellowing, or continued wilting would signal that additional root aeration or repotting into a lighter mix with 30 % perlite is needed."}]}

The clustered distribution and condensation droplets on the inner lid suggest prolonged high humidity and limited airflow as the primary catalyst. Immediately cull and discard every berry with visible mold, then space remaining plants or packaged fruit so air can circulate freely; in the field, maintain 30 cm row spacing and irrigate early morning only, delivering no more than 2.5 cm of water in a 20-minute cycle to keep foliage dry by nightfall. Add a loose 5 cm layer of clean straw mulch beneath plants to reduce splash dispersal, and remove senescent leaves or fruit twice weekly, cutting at least 1 cm above the cap with sterilized shears. Over the next 7 days, visually inspect fruit each morning for fresh white or grey fuzz rings wider than 3 mm, check that leaf surfaces dry within 2 hours after watering, and monitor for new water-soaked spots around seeds; record findings daily to verify humidity control measures are working."}]}

Several berries show irregular patches of fluffy white-to-pale-gray mycelium, especially around the calyx and shoulder, while adjacent fruits are still glossy red; the mold appears powdery and slightly raised, indicating active sporulation. Some affected areas are water-soaked and dull, and the infection is clustered where fruits touch each other, pointing to moisture entrapment. These visual cues align with Botrytis cinerea outbreaks that favor cool, humid, low-airflow conditions in densely packed fruit. Immediately cull and discard all berries with visible mold and any that were in direct contact, then thin canopy or tray spacing to at least 25 cm (10 in) between plants/boxes to improve air movement. Irrigate at soil level early morning, supplying about 2 cm (¾ in) of water once every 3–4 days, and apply a loose 5 cm (2 in) layer of clean straw mulch to keep fruit off damp soil. Over the next 7 days, visually check daily for new white or gray tufts on the blossom end of developing berries, feel the mulch each morning to confirm it is dry to the touch, and use a hygrometer to keep relative humidity around the plants below 60% during daylight hours."}]}

I observe dense, cottony white to light-gray fungal mats covering large patches of each berry, water-soaked brown tissue just beneath the mycelium, sporadic soft collapse of the fruit surface, and a concentric spread pattern that begins at the calyx end and migrates downward. These visual signs point to Botrytis cinerea exploiting high surface moisture and stagnant air around ripening fruit. Immediately prune out and discard all infected berries and any touching leaves, ensuring cuts are made at least 2 cm (¾ in) into Healthy tissue to limit spore carry-over; then thin foliage so that adjacent crowns maintain a 20–25 cm (8–10 in) gap for cross-breeze. Shift irrigation to early morning only, applying 1.5 cm (½ in) of water at soil level with drip or soaker lines to keep fruit dry; add a 5 cm (2 in) layer of clean straw mulch beneath clusters to block splash-up. Over the next 7 days, inspect daily for any new fluffy white growth on the underside of developing berries, touch-test fruit firmness to detect fresh soft spots, and monitor midday relative humidity inside the canopy aiming to keep it below 70% by temporarily lifting row covers or using fans if needed."}]}
