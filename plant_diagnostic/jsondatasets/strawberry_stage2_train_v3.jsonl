Visible clues include (1) a sparse, wiry root mass with very few white feeder roots, (2) several primary roots turning dark brown and brittle, (3) crown tissue showing patchy caramel-brown discoloration rather than uniform creamy white, (4) slight collapse and shriveling at the crown-root junction, and (5) no visible root hairs on the bottom 4–5 cm of the plant. This combination points to water-saturated soil that favored soil-borne fungi and deprived roots of oxygen, leading to root rot. Immediately transplant survivors into a raised bed or container at least 15 cm (6 in) high with a well-drained mix containing 30 % coarse compost and 20 % perlite; irrigate to a depth of 5 cm (2 in) only when the top 3 cm (1 in) of soil is dry, and ensure drainage holes remain clear. Space plants 30 cm (12 in) apart and mulch with a 2 cm (¾ in) layer of clean straw to reduce splash without trapping excess moisture. Over the next 7 days, visually check that the upper 3 cm of soil dries within 48 h after watering, confirm new white root tips are visible through the drainage holes or at the crown base, and watch for any fresh crown softening or dark streaks; absence of these signs indicates recovery."}]}

These symptoms point to prolonged saturation and poor drainage that favor anaerobic pathogens such as Phytophthora or Pythium attacking the root system. Raise the planting bed at least 15 cm (6 in) and blend 5 cm (2 in) of coarse composted bark through the top 20 cm (8 in) to improve porosity and runoff; switch to deep, infrequent irrigation by applying 2.5 cm (1 in) of water once every 5 days only after the top 5 cm (2 in) of soil feels dry; and remove infected plants promptly, sanitizing cutting tools for 2 minutes in a 10 % bleach solution to prevent spread. For the next 7 days, check soil moisture at 5 cm depth each morning before watering, inspect crowns daily for any new dark streaks or amber exudate, and gently expose a few root tips every other day to verify the emergence of firm, white roots rather than continued browning."}]}

These symptoms together point to rot caused by prolonged soil saturation and limited oxygen, favouring soil-borne fungi such as Phytophthora or Pythium. Immediately lift plants onto a bed or ridge at least 20 cm high, incorporate 5 cm of coarse compost or pine bark into the top 15 cm of soil to improve drainage, and restrict irrigation to when the top 5 cm of soil is dry, delivering no more than 2 cm of water in a single application. Maintain open canopy airflow by spacing plants 30 cm apart and remove any obviously decayed roots with sanitized snips to reduce inoculum. Over the next seven days, visually check daily for development of fresh white root tips at the crown base, squeeze the crown to confirm it remains firm not spongy, and inspect soil surface each morning to ensure it is only slightly moist and never puddled."}]}

This pattern of discoloration, cortical decay and missing fine roots indicates prolonged saturation that favours rot-causing fungi such as Phytophthora or Pythium. Lift and replant in a raised bed 15–20 cm high and at least 30 cm wide to improve drainage, irrigating only when the top 3 cm of soil is dry and then applying no more than 2 cm of water via drip in the early morning; discard all obviously infected plants and sanitize pruners with 70 % alcohol between cuts. Mulch with a 2-cm layer of clean straw to reduce splashing and maintain even but not soggy moisture, and ensure 25 cm of plant spacing for airflow around crowns. Over the next 7 days, probe the soil each morning to 3 cm depth and verify it is only lightly damp, inspect the crown base for any fresh reddish-brown streaking or soft spots, and gently expose a few roots every other day to confirm new growth is white, firm and turgid rather than tan or mushy."}]}

The central crown tissue shows a wet-looking orange-brown discoloration, several primary roots are dark and brittle rather than cream-white, fine feeder roots are largely missing, and a few remaining roots exhibit shrivelling with a water-soaked sheen. Such patchy browning that begins at the crown and moves outward typically indicates decay from excess moisture and poor aeration allowing rot-pathogens to colonize. Immediately improve drainage by raising the planting row 15–20 cm and incorporating 4 cm of coarse compost and perlite to loosen soil; water no more than 2.5 cm every 4–5 days, ensuring the top 5 cm dries slightly between irrigations; apply a 2 cm straw mulch layer to keep surface moist but crown dry. Increase airflow by spacing plants 30 cm apart and removing any dead foliage touching the soil to discourage further pathogen spread. Over the next 7 days, lift one sample plant every two days to check that new root tips appear white and firm, probe soil at 10 cm depth each morning aiming for crumbly not soggy consistency, and inspect the crown base daily for any fresh darkening or soft, sour-smelling tissue so corrective action can be taken promptly."}]}

These patterns indicate prolonged saturation and limited oxygen around the root zone, favouring soil-borne pathogens that cause crown and root rot. Immediately lift the plant into a raised bed or pot with a 15-20 cm deep mix of 60 % coarse sand and 40 % composted bark to improve drainage, and irrigate only when the top 2.5 cm of medium is dry, applying about 1.5–2 cm of water in the early morning so the root zone dries by nightfall. Remove and discard all visibly brown or mushy roots, then replant so the crown sits 1 cm above the soil line, and place a 2 cm layer of clean straw mulch around (not touching) the crown to moderate moisture swings. Over the next 7 days, inspect daily for new white root tips emerging at the container edge, press the crown gently to confirm it is firm rather than spongy, and use a moisture probe or finger to keep soil at a moderate (40–50 %) moisture level, adjusting watering if the reading at 5 cm depth stays above this range.

Cross-sectioned crowns display a dark reddish-brown core bordered by soft yellow exudate, the surrounding root cortex is blackened and sloughing, and there are virtually no white feeder roots, while in the bed a distinct patch of plants shows complete leaf desiccation contrasted against adjacent healthy green foliage. These clustered, water-soaked lesions and rapid plant collapse point to root/crown rot driven by prolonged soil saturation that favors soilborne pathogens. Immediately remove the visibly dead clump plus 20 cm of adjoining soil and plant material, discard off-site, and improve drainage by lifting the bed with an additional 7–10 cm of well-draining composted mix. Irrigate only in the early morning every 3–4 days, delivering 1.5 cm of water each time and allowing the top 5 cm of soil to dry before the next cycle; avoid standing water around crowns. Spread a 2 cm layer of coarse straw mulch to reduce surface compaction and splash dispersal, and keep foliage spacing at least 15 cm between crowns to enhance airflow.

Both pots sit in water-filled saucers and the soil surface looks constantly saturated, pointing to prolonged waterlogging that deprives roots of oxygen and invites rot-causing fungi. Remove both pots from the saucers, clear the drainage holes, and repot the sick plant into a mix of 2 parts peat-based compost and 1 part coarse perlite, trimming off all dark roots and keeping the crown no deeper than 1 cm below the surface.
