# Test Files

This folder contains various test scripts for the Plant Diagnostic System. These are legacy test files that were used during development and debugging.

## Test Files

### Core System Tests
- **`test_build.py`** - Tests for building the system components
- **`test_config.py`** - Tests for configuration loading and validation
- **`test_dataset.py`** - Basic dataset loading tests
- **`test_init.py`** - Tests for system initialization

### VQA (Visual Question Answering) Tests
- **`test_vqa.py`** - Main VQA dataset testing
- **`test_vqa_dataset.py`** - VQA dataset loading and processing tests
- **`test_vqa_direct.py`** - Direct VQA model testing
- **`test_vqa_load.py`** - VQA data loading tests
- **`test_vqa_simple.py`** - Simplified VQA testing

## Usage

These test files are kept for reference and historical purposes. They were used during the development phase to validate various components of the system.

For current testing, use the main demo files in the root directory:
- `demo_v4.py` - Previous stable version
- `demo_v5.py` - Latest version with all features

## Note

These are legacy test files and may not be fully compatible with the current system configuration. They are preserved for development reference only.
